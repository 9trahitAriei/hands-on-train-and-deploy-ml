## The problem
Training models inside notebooks is easy. Unfortunately, this is not enough when you want to build **complete** ML solutions for real-world problems.

In this hands-on tutorial you will learn how to
- **train** an ML model that predicts crypto prices, and
- **deploy** this model as a REST API

We will use Serverless ML tools to
- track experiment runs and publish our best model to the registy, with CometML.
- deploy the model as a REST API, with Cerebrium.

Without further ado, let's get to work!

## Run the whole thing in 7 steps

1. Create a Python virtual environment with all project dependencies with

    ```
    $ make init
    ```


2. Set your API keys for [CometML]() and [Cerebrium]() in `set_environment_variables_template.sh`, rename the file and run (you can skip `CEREBRIUM_ENDPOINT_URL` for now)
    ```
    $ . ./set_environment_variables.sh
    ```

3. Download historical data from Coinbase and save it locally to disk
    ```
    $ make data
    ```

4. Train ML model
    ```
    $ make train
    ```

5. Deploy the model
    ```
    $ make deploy
    ```

6. Take the endpoint URL you get from Cerebrim in the previous step, and set the `CEREBRIUM_ENDPOINT_URL` variable in `set_environment_variables.sh`. Then re-run
    ```
    $ . ./set_environment_variables.sh
    ```

7. Test the endpoint works
    ```
    $ make test-endpoint
    ```
