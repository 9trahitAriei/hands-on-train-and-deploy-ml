## The problem
Training models inside notebooks is easy. Unfortunately, this is not enough when you want to build **complete** ML solutions for real-world problems.

In this hands-on tutorial you will learn how to
- **train** an ML model that predicts crypto prices, and
- **deploy** this model as a REST API

You will use Serverless ML tools to
- track experiment runs and publish our best model to the registy, with CometML.
- deploy the model as a REST API, with Cerebrium.

Without further ado, let's get to work!
