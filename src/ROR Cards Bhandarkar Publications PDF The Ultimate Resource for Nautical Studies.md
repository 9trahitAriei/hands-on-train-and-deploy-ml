ROR cards are a set of flashcards that show different scenarios of vessels encountering each other at sea and the corresponding signals and actions they should take to avoid collision. ROR stands for Rules of the Road, which are the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea. ROR cards are designed to help seafarers learn and practice these rules in a simple and interactive way.
 
ROR cards are available in different formats and sources. One of the most popular sources is Bhandarkar Publications, which is a leading publisher of maritime books and guides in India. Bhandarkar Publications offers ROR cards in both physical and digital formats. The physical cards are made of laminated paper and come in a box with a booklet that explains the rules and answers. The digital cards are available as an app for Android devices, which can be downloaded from Google Play Store[^1^]. The app also provides explanations, quizzes, and feedback.

ROR cards are useful for both beginners and experienced seafarers who want to refresh their knowledge of the rules of the road. They can be used as a self-study tool or as a teaching aid in maritime training institutes. ROR cards cover various situations such as meeting, crossing, overtaking, head-on, restricted visibility, sound signals, lights, shapes, and distress signals. By using ROR cards regularly, seafarers can improve their situational awareness and decision-making skills when navigating at sea.

ROR cards are not only useful for seafarers, but also for other maritime professionals and enthusiasts who want to learn more about the rules of the road. For example, yacht owners, recreational boaters, fishermen, marine surveyors, lawyers, and students can benefit from using ROR cards to enhance their understanding of the maritime law and practice. ROR cards can also help prepare for various maritime exams and certifications, such as the Certificate of Competency (COC), the General Operator's Certificate (GOC), and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).
 
ROR cards are not meant to replace the official sources of the rules of the road, such as the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREGS), the International Code of Signals (ICS), and the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR). ROR cards are only a supplementary tool that can help seafarers memorize and apply the rules in a practical way. Seafarers should always refer to the official sources for the most accurate and updated information on the rules of the road.
 
ROR cards are a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn the rules of the road in a fun and easy way. By using ROR cards regularly, seafarers can improve their safety and efficiency at sea. ROR cards can also help foster a culture of compliance and professionalism among the maritime community.
