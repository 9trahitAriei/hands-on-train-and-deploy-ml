# How to Get a License for Altera DSP Builder
 
Altera DSP Builder is a digital signal processing (DSP) design tool that enables Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation of DSP algorithms directly from the MathWorks Simulink environment onto Intel FPGAs[^4^]. The tool generates high quality, synthesizable VHDL/Verilog code from MATLAB functions, and Simulink models[^4^]. The generated Register Transfer Level (RTL) code can be used for Intel FPGA programming[^4^].

Altera DSP Builder is widely used in radar designs, wireless and wireline communication designs, medical imaging, and motor control applications[^4^]. However, to use this tool, you need a license from Intel. In this article, we will show you how to get a license for Altera DSP Builder and how to avoid illegal or cracked versions of the software.
 
## Why You Need a License for Altera DSP Builder
 
A license for Altera DSP Builder is required to access the full functionality of the tool and to generate code for Intel FPGAs. Without a license, you can only use the tool for simulation and verification purposes, but not for code generation or synthesis[^4^]. A license also entitles you to technical support and software updates from Intel.

A license for Altera DSP Builder is not free. You need to purchase it from Intel or an authorized distributor. The price of the license depends on the edition of the tool (Pro or Standard), the duration of the license (perpetual or subscription), and the number of users (single or network). You can find more information about the pricing and licensing options on the [Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/dsp-builder.html).
 
## How to Get a License for Altera DSP Builder
 
To get a license for Altera DSP Builder, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install the Intel Quartus Prime Software and the MathWorks MATLAB and Simulink software on your computer. You can download the Intel Quartus Prime Software from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html) and the MathWorks MATLAB and Simulink software from [here](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/). Make sure you have compatible versions of both software.
2. Purchase a license for Altera DSP Builder from Intel or an authorized distributor. You can choose between Pro Edition or Standard Edition, perpetual or subscription license, and single or network license. You will receive a license file (.dat) via email after your purchase.
3. Add your license file to your MATLAB installation. You can do this by copying the license file to your MATLAB installation folder or by setting an environment variable called LM\_LICENSE\_FILE that points to the location of your license file. You can find more details on how to add your license file to your MATLAB installation [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/hdlcoder/ug/add-your-dsp-builder-license-to-your-matlab-installation.html).
4. Download and install the Altera DSP Builder software from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/dsp-builder.html). Choose the edition that matches your license (Pro or Standard) and follow the installation instructions.
5. Launch MATLAB and Simulink and verify that you can access the Altera DSP Builder blocks in the Simulink Library Browser. You should see two libraries: Altera DSP Builder Advanced Blockset and Altera DSP Builder Standard Blockset. You can use these blocks to design your DSP algorithms and generate HDL code for Intel FPGAs.

## How to Avoid Illegal or Cracked Versions of Altera DSP Builder
 
Some websites may offer illegal or cracked versions of Altera DSP Builder that claim to bypass the licensing requirements. However, these versions are not authorized by Intel and may contain malware, viruses, or other harmful components that can damage your computer or compromise
